# What is Python?

### Background

Python is an Interpreted Language. There is a difference between interpreted language and compiled language.

In C and C++, which are compiled languages, the code is first converted to object code or machine code. Then the object is executed. You only need to compile the code once.

Unlike C and C++, python interepreter interprets each line at the time of execution. This is something called Just in Time Compilation(JIT Compilation). We will discuss JIT compilation else where.
